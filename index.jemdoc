== About me
I am currently a professor, [http://www.njust.edu.cn Nanjing University of Science and Technology], China. I was a research scientist in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/ New York University Abu Dhabi] and [https://engineering.nyu.edu/ New York University Tandon School of Engineering]. I did my Ph.D study in the Department of Computing, [https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ Hong Kong Polytechnic University], under the supervision of Prof. [http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/ Lei Zhang]. Here is my full [pdf/JinXie.pdf CV].
